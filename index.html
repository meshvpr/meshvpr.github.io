        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        Visual Place Recognition (VPR), i.e., the task of finding the location
        of a photo, is commonly addressed as an image retrieval problem from a
        database of geo-tagged images. Despite being often overlooked, the
        collection of such a database is a practical challenge, particularly for
        large-scale settings when the VPR system must be deployed to one or
        multiple cities. To solve this problem we introduce a hybrid VPR
        pipeline which leverages the increasing availability of free 3D meshes
        of entire cities. Our pipeline, called MeshVPR, uses 3D meshes to create
        a database of synthetic images from arbitrary views for the deployment
        of a VPR model pre-trained on real data. We further use a lightweight
        fine-tuning features alignment step in order to handle the appearance
        gap between real and synthetic images. MeshVPR allows to quickly deploy
        a VPR model to any city, as proven by creating a system for Berlin in
        less than a day. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MeshVPR achieves
        results that are competitive w.r.t traditional VPR systems that use
        databases of real images (only 5% drop in Recall@5).

          <b>Our proposed pipeline for hybrid image retrieval.</b> The training phase
          is made of steps 1, 2 and 3, and can be performed on any city with a
          dataset of real images and a 3D mesh (we use San Francisco). Once the
          training phase is completed, the deployment phase can take part on any
          target city: in this paper we show results on Berlin, Paris and
          Melbourne. More in details, steps 1 and 2 aim at creating a set of
          real-synthetic pairs of images, to be used for the features alignment
          step (3). For the deployment, a database of synthetic images is
          extracted from any target 3D city mesh (step 4), and finally our
          proposed hybrid retrieval architecture is employed to geo localize
          real-world query images (step 5)
